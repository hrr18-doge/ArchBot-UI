There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > DogeBot Over9000

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A Web Archive For Your Over 9000 Slack Messages

## Summary ##
  > Protect your valuable conversations from Slack's limitation of saving only 10,000 messages by adding our custom bot. Search your personal archive to find any chats you want to reread.

## Problem ##
  > Slack's free channel accounts will only save the 10,000 most recent messages and actively purges valuable older conversations.

## Solution ##
  > After being invited to your Slack channel, DogeBot quietly saves and stores your messages in an easily accessible and searchable website for your convenience. The website requires a login and password that is provided from Dogebot via a custom Slack command.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Don't Be A Dick" - Patrik K., Scrum Master

## How to Get Started ##
  > Download our DogeBot and client/server repositories and push each to its own Heroku account (or use ours!). Invite DogeBot to a Slack channel and watch as messages are stored effortlessly in the client app. Tell Dogebot "Dogebot give me a password!" to access your message archieve on the client. Built with MR NEWB -- MongoDB, React, Node, Express, Webpack and Bootstrap.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Finally, I can settle arguments fair and square whenever someone misquotes me." - Michael Jordan, former professional baseball player.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > We recommend adding Redux and client-side routing, as well as data visualization for all of your newly stored messages. Other possibilities include adding custom Slack commands to your Bot so it retrieves messages from you and prints them in your Slack channel. The front end needs styling as well.
